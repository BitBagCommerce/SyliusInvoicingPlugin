Reporting a Bug
===============

Whenever you find a bug in Sylius, we kindly ask you to report it. It helps
us make a better e-commerce solution for PHP.

.. caution::

    If you think you've found a security issue, please use the special
    :doc:`procedure <security>` instead.

Before submitting a bug:

* Double-check the official `documentation`_ to see if you're not misusing the
  framework;

* Ask for assistance on `stackoverflow.com`_ or on the
  #sylius `IRC channel`_ if you're not sure your issue is really a bug.

If your problem definitely looks like a bug, report it using the official bug
`tracker`_ and follow some basic rules:

* Use the title field to clearly describe the issue;

* Describe the steps needed to reproduce the bug with short code examples
  (providing a Behat scenario that illustrates the bug is best);

* Give as much detail as possible about your environment (OS, PHP version,
  Symfony version, Sylius version, enabled extensions, ...);

* *(optional)* Attach a :doc:`patch <patches>`.

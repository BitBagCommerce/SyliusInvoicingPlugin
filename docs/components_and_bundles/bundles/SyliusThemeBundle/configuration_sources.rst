Configuration sources
=====================

To discover themes that are defined in the application, ThemeBundle uses configuration sources.

Existing configuration sources
------------------------------

.. toctree::
    :titlesonly:

    configuration_sources/filesystem
    configuration_sources/test

Creating custom configuration source
------------------------------------

If there is no existing configuration source that fulfills your needs, you can also :doc:`create a new one <configuration_sources/creating_custom>`.

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    configuration_sources/creating_custom

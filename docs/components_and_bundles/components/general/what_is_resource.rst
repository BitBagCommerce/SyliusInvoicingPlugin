What is a Resource?
===================

We refer to data models as "Resources". In the simplest words, some examples that you will find in Sylius:

* Product
* TaxRate
* Order
* OrderItem
* ShippingMethod
* PaymentMethod

As you can already guess, there are many more Resources in Sylius. It is a really simple but powerful concept that allows us to create a nice abstraction to handle all the complex logic of E-Commerce.
When using Components, you will have access to the resources provided by them out-of-the-box.

What is more, you will be able to create your own, custom Resources and benefit from all features provided by Sylius.
